# Release Workflow Fix Summary

## Issue
The v2.2.11 release was created successfully but contained no Mac or Windows binary files, only source code. Users could not download the application installers.

## Root Cause
The GitHub Actions release workflow had incorrect file path patterns when attempting to attach build artifacts to releases:

**Incorrect patterns (before fix):**
```yaml
files: |
  artifacts/build-mac/release/*.dmg
  artifacts/build-mac/release/*.zip
  artifacts/build-win/release/*.exe
```

**Actual artifact structure:**
```
artifacts/
├── build-mac/
│   ├── Film-Recipe-Wizard-2.2.12-mac-universal.dmg
│   └── Film-Recipe-Wizard-2.2.12-mac-universal.zip
└── build-win/
    └── Film-Recipe-Wizard-2.2.12-Setup.exe
```

The issue occurred because:
1. The build jobs upload artifacts from the `release/` directory
2. GitHub Actions `download-artifact` action places the contents directly in `artifacts/build-{platform}/`
3. There is no intermediate `release/` subdirectory in the downloaded artifacts

## Fix
Updated the file patterns in `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml`:

**Corrected patterns (after fix):**
```yaml
files: |
  artifacts/build-mac/*.dmg
  artifacts/build-mac/*.zip
  artifacts/build-win/*.exe
```

## Additional Improvements
- Added comprehensive debugging output to show artifact directory structure
- Added verification step to check that required files exist before release creation
- Enhanced error reporting for future troubleshooting

## Testing
- Version bumped to 2.2.12 to test the fix
- All build and type checking passes
- Simulated artifact structure confirms patterns work correctly

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml` - Fixed file patterns and added debugging
- `package.json` - Bumped version to 2.2.12 for testing

The fix ensures that future releases will properly include Mac and Windows binary files for users to download.
